# lolcat

A c++ implementation of the lolcat command forked from [jaseg](https://github.com/jaseg/lolcat).

## Why?

I wanted something a tad faster than the C implementation from Jaseg; as I want
to use it in my command-line prompt. There were some bugs that I've cleaned up,
but I also want to add a few modes that are customized for using in particular
scenarios.
